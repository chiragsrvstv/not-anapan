# TTC (Things To Consider)
- There might not always be opportunities. Would depend how much a company believes in offloading the task.
- What is our goal: to enable them to land to the right doors
- How will we keep going; How will this be repeated; reports are quarterly; how would we keep bringing new actionable insights?


# Approach 1
- Different agents responsible for extracting data from sources.
- Those agents are not aware the larger context.
- One final AI that would then make sense of all these info and would give out opportunities.

- All the agents are contextually aware that this information would be used then used to make a report.
- There is a final agent which will take all this info and make a final report.


# Approach 3
- Different agents tasked to extract information from different sources.
- All the agents are derriving 'opportunities' from their own sources.
- All this is passed to a final agent that verifies and generates the final report.
