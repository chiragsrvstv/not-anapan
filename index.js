  # Instructions
  - Make a report on the sales opportunities for ${client} based on the provided analysis reports.
  - Start with concise account summary including the markets they operate in, their offerings and business verticals, and major highlights such as recent mergers, acquisitions, or leadership changes.
  - Provide with actionable insights that are in-depth, number-backed, and to the point.
  - Spot relevant signals, opportunities and possible solutions in the prospect company for your sales director in ${client}.
  - Only provide realistic opportunities, do not blindly fit services. Your sales director is unforgiving of mistakes.
  - A good opportunity lies in an area where the prospect is struggling, something which is of priority to them, and areas where they are massively hiring.
  - Provide insights that are easy for sales leaders to understand and act upon, avoiding jargon.
  - Think step by step and give reasons to back the opportunities.
  - Trace the specific point for the reason from the report.
  - Figure out the exact stakeholder with the name in the organization who can be contacted for the opportunity.
  - Do not hallucinate.
  - Do not add any information on your own, only use whatever you've been provided in the reports and other data.
  - Return the results in Markdown format.
